# BungeeCrack
Allows running BungeeCord in offline mode without making changes to the config.yml

## Why?
I created this because SimpleCloud normally doesn't allow running BungeeCord in offline mode.
Maybe it is useful for someone else.

## Forks of BungeeCord
BungeeCrack is built for and tested on Travertine and normal BungeeCord but it should run on most if not all forks.

## Cloud systems
BungeeCrack is specifically made for SimpleCloud. It probably works with CloudNet as well but CloudNet already supports running a server in offline mode so idk why you would use it.
